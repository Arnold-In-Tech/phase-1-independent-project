Typical symptoms include whitish patches on the lower leaf surface, yellow spots on the upper surface, and a powdery appearance due to white spores. Leaves may exhibit curling and dropping, while buds become more vulnerable to winter damage. Infected fruit may develop a netlike russeting. "

It produces asexual spores called conidia, which spread through wind or insects, causing new infections. Under specific conditions, it forms sexual fruiting bodies called chasmothecia, which produce sexual spores called ascospores. These ascospores can survive tough conditions and infect plants in the following seasons. The ability to reproduce both ways helps powdery mildew survive, spread, and adapt as a plant disease."

          "description": "Trametes versicolor, also known as Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor, is a mushroom found worldwide. It has distinctive concentric rings and a papery texture, resembling a turkey tail. This mushroom prefers dead or decaying hardwood, especially beech and oak, and thrives in moist and temperate environments like forests and woodlands. It has immune-boosting and anti-cancer properties, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects and potential medical applications."

          "subtitle": "How does Sappy bark, Turkey tail (Trametes versicolor) occur?",
          "description": "The disease enters tree limbs and larger branches through pruning cuts. Infected bark and wood tissues decay, leading to a spongy and discolored appearance. The affected bark may peel away, revealing decayed tissue underneath. In humid conditions, the bark looks spongy, while in dry conditions, it appears papery. Dark sap may ooze from diseased areas, and spore-producing structures can form along the edges. Bark cankers can encircle branches or, if on the trunk, cause tree death."

This helps prevent the spread of the fungus to other trees.\n\n•\tEnsure good air circulation around trees by spacing them properly and avoiding overcrowding. This helps reduce the favorable conditions for fungal growth.\n\n•\tMinimize tree wounds by preventing mechanical damage, such as from lawnmowers or construction equipment. Promptly treat any wounds that do occur to prevent fungal entry points.\n"

Infected fruits may exhibit ridges and decay during postharvest storage."

Spores develop and are dispersed by wind or water onto blossoms or young leaves in favorable conditions. Germination happens with cool temperatures and high humidity. It enters plants through wounds but rarely penetrates healthy tissue directly. Decaying plant material and dense plant populations contribute to its spread. The fungus feeds on plants, causing gray mold and decay known as Botrytis rot."
