                <p>BugScout is a pocket friendly tool that helps farmers identify disease symptoms
                    early in the growing season. According to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation),
                    20%-40% of global crop production is lost to pests annually. Poor crop yields are 
                    caused by the inability of farmers to effectively keep a check on plant health to 
                    ensure timely disease prevention.

                <p>Currently, farmers have to use magnifying glasses when looking at disease symptoms.
                    Also, they have to carry along a healthy plant for comparison purposes. These 
                    methods are archaic, prone to error and are tedious.

                <p>BugScout will provide a user-friendly interface where farmers can visually compare and
                    differentiate healthy from diseased plants. Consequently, farmers can make timely 
                    decisions regarding fungicide application before the disease infestation and economic
                    losses occur. Also, the tool will prevent disease diagnosis errors</p>
